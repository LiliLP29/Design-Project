<p>Hip hop began in the streets of Bronx, New York City in the 1970s. It’s often the style you see in the background of music videos. Hip hop is a big umbrella term that includes a lot of other elements other than the dance style, such as DJing and MCing. To hip hop, you need to master the high energy, complicated footwork and attitude that most dances demand. This dance style includes many “sub-styles” like  popping, locking, krumping, waacking, house and breakdancing. Matt Steffanina is an american hip hop choreographer from LA, bellow is one of his videos. <br><br> My source: <a href=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/hip-hop-dance-explained target="_blank">MasterClass</a></p>
