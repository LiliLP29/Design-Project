<p>Jazz is a style that comes from a mix of African and European styles. It started back in 1600 during the West African slave trade. Jazz dances are often upbeat and full of energy. There are also often a lot of sharp movements. Some jazz technique is derived from ballet, as are a lot of technique styles. There are also styles that branch off of jazz, one you might know is called broadway. Broadway jazz is the style of dance, like it says in the name, that is danced on broadway. Broadway jazz if often made up of extremely exaggerated and big movements and facial expressions because when youâ€™re on a huge stage like on broadway, you want to make it big enough so that everyone can see. A very well known jazz choreographer is Bob Fosse who's choreographies are known for their turned in knees, jazz hands and more. <br><br> My source: <a href=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/jazz-dance-guide target="_blank">MasterClass</a>  </p>
