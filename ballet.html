<p>If you were introduced to dance as a young child, you most likely started out in ballet classes. It is perhaps for this reason that people don't realize the actual strength, technique and talent it takes to dance ballet at a professional level. Ballet is probably one of the most classical styles of dance. It began during the italian renaissance in the 15th century and from there, the technique was adapted by Russia and France. Professional female dancers perform ballet on pointe. Pointe shoes have many layers of papier mache which makes the toe part very hard. These shoes literally make the dancer stand on the tips of her toes. The style consists of a lot of jumps, turns all while keeping a certain degree of control, which requires a lot of strength from the dancer.<br><br> My source: <a href=https://www.britannica.com/art/ballet target="_blank">Britannica</a></p>
