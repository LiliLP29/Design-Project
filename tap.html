<p>Tap dance originated in the United States by mixing multiple dance styles from different cultures, mostly West African step dances. Additionally, Scottish, Irish and English jigs. In the last few decades of the 1900s, tap dancing was created from enslaved Africans and Irish watching eachother dance. Tap is danced in special shoes called tap shoes. These shoes have metal screwed in on the toe and the heel area. The style consists of tapping the floor with your feet and mimicking the rhythm of the music. The Nicholas Brothers, Fayard and Harold are arguably one of the best tap duos of all time.<br><br> My source: <a href=https://www.britannica.com/art/tap-dance target="_blank">Britannica</a></p>
